CODENAME: Eclipse
LAUNCH: Q2 2008
=====

#	Dynamic acceptance and rejection messages
		*	Using a character (or two), an admin should be able to define where dynamic elements,
			like position and rank, are added to the acceptance and rejection emails.
#	Departmental databases
#	Add CC ability for private messages
		*	Should be able to add 5 CCs to their messages
		*	Options for Command Staff, Senior Staff, and Entire Crew in the list
#	Personalized SMS Menu
#	Customizable message subject lines
		*	Emails currently use [Ship Name], but users should be able to customize that
		*	Default will be [Ship Name]
#	Clean-up install and update files
		*	Installation file should be made up of several smaller files to help keep initial
			file size down. The different files should be structured accordingly:
				@	Structure - all of the create table commands
				@	Data - all of the data that needs to be put into the table
		*	The update file should be broken up as well so that every single update file does
			not need to be updated each time there is a release. Each release should have one
			file and the main update file should be looping through to grab the files as needed
		*	Character sets and collations need to be explicitly defined during install
		*	What about update?
#	Tab content immediately available
		*	Current tab setup requires the page to be reloaded in order to view what's inside the
			tab. Should be changed so that user can switch between content immediately.

#	Global setting for default access levels
#	Starbase menu items in place during install, but turned off
		*	Unfortunately, there's no good way to dynamically turn the starship stuff off and
			turn the starbase stuff on. The only way to do it would be to query for the URL
			that's being used, turn off those items, then turn on the other ones, but I'm
			not sure if we want to be going through all that trouble.
#	Error catching page
#	Rank drop down menus need to respect the rankDisplay flag
#	Add cadet ranks (off by default)
#	SMS Update options
		*	Admins should be able to dictate exactly which updates they're notified of.
				@	All Updates - notifies of all updates: major and minor
				@	Major Only - notifies only of 2.x.0 releases and not of 2.x.x releases
				@	No Updates - will turn off the notification system (users who choose
					this option put themselves at risk in the event of a security release)
#	"Private" news messages
		*	People should be able to set news items as private, meaning that only registered
			crew can see them, be that when they're logged in or not
#	[BUG] Database uses integer fields for the crew compliment section, meaning that if a comma
	is used, the query will strip everything from the invalid character on
#	Toggle boxes should use jQuery instead of the custom Javascript code
#	Logic on the awards page to check for the existence of the large version of the image, and
	if it doesn't exist, fall back to the smaller version.
#	Update system queries
		*	System queries should be safe from SQL injection; see join page for example
#	[BUG] Player stats page doesn't have any logic for a zero or blank UNIX timestamp
#	Award categories
		*	COs should be able to set categories for awards, much like they can set categories
			for news items now
		*	http://forums.anodyne-productions.com/viewtopic.php?t=1167
		*	Option for whether it's an in character or out of character award
		*	Will allow NPCs to be given IC awards
#	Extra information on award
		*	Timestamp
		*	Reason
		*	1,Timestamp:Reason; 2,Timestamp:Reason; etc.
#	Nominated Awards To a Queue
		*	When someone nominates another crew member for an award, it'll put it up for
			approval, much like a new crew member that the CO can review and then approve
			and not approve.  If approved, the award will be activated on the player's
			account, otherwise, it'll be deleted
#	Specifications and join pages to be dynamically built
		*	Will use separate tables like the OKI LMI uses (formFields, formValues, formData)
		*	Will allow admins to specify exactly what they want to see on those two
			pages
		*	Tough part will be the join page and getting things to be spit out in an email
			the way they should be
#	List all steps in installation and updating
		*	All the steps should be listed with each step being highlighted as it's active
#	Clean up icons included with SMS
		*	Remove icons
