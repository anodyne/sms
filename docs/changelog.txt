FIXES
===

*	Fixed bug where rank menus didn't respect the rankDisplay flag
*	Fixed bug where the system check class would try to write something to the main ACP even if there was nothing to write, causing an extra space
*	Fixed bug where crew compliment fields would only allow integers (commas would break things)
*	Fixed bug where player stats page would throw back some weird data if there wasn't a properly formatted join date
*	Fixed bug where changing a playing character to something else (or vice versa) wouldn't affect the open positions
*	Fixed bug where contact page wouldn't send mail out
*	Fixed bug where the read more prompts in the control panel could break right in the middle
*	Fixed all the Apache warnings and errors SMS would dump into the server error logs (will make server admins VERY happy)
*	Fixed bug where the crew awards page would, in some situations, print the award name twice
*	Fixed bug where someone with full XO privileges could create a CO character (thought without the CO access levels)
*	Fixed bug where mission status wasn't inserted into the database
*	Fixed bug in the 2.4.4 update script where a semicolon was missing
